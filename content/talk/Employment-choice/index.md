# Abstract

The objective of this paper is to examine how various job attributes affect university students’
utility and their tendencies to choose different job sectors. In this study, the Discrete Choice
Experiment (DCE) is adopted among 213 students at Bangladesh University of professionals
(BUP) to elicit the willingness to accept (WTA). The WTA is used in the absence of specific job
attributes such as job security, working hours and the opportunity of using the knowledge or
skills they gained during bachelor or masters. Using a stated preference method allows
calculation of WTA for benefits in this setting, despite the lack of data on student’s actual
experience in the job sector, which makes it difficult to use revealed preference methods. After conducting an econometric analysis by following a conditional logit model, it is evident from our findings that students prefer the public job sector more than the private job or entrepreneurship and higher study. Having job security increases their utility by 0.358 units and they require 16 thousand of taka for the absence of job security. Working for longer hours such as 46-60 hours and 61-75 hours decreases their utility by 0.390 units and 0.252 units respectively. Not using previous knowledge or skills increases their utility by 0.268 units. Female students and master’s students need more compensation if there is no job security. Also, female students are required more compensation than males for longer working hours.
