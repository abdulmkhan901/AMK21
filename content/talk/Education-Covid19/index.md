title: "Effective Online Learning During Crisis"
subtitle: "A Proposed Model for Effective Online Learning During Crisis using Discrete Choice Experiment Method: A Study on the Students of Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) During COVID-19"
excerpt: "The paper presents an application of a discrete choice experiment that aims to find out the preferences of the online classes to ensure efficient learning. The experiment method is employed to identify the key attributes of online classes that the students prefer the most. The specific focus in the study was the students of Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP), which has been the forerunner in Bangladesh in taking online classes since the beginning of Covid-19 at tertiary level. Data has been collected from a sample of 243 BUP students. The findings suggest that optimal learning is ensured when interrupted video on the study topic is provided prior to a 30-60-minute-long discussion between the students and teachers on the same topic. Students have also shown a preference for the usage of Digital Whiteboard as the lecture conduct method. The result has policy implications in ensuring effective online education in nontechnical subjects at the tertiary level. The optimum model can be replicated during educational disruption due to natural disasters and even in areas difficult to access, like hill tracks of Bangladesh."
