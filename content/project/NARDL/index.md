# Abstract

We examine the long-run relationship between tourism development and economic growth using the Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model for Bangladesh using annual data from 1980 to 2016. We find an asymmetric relationship between tourism and Bangladesh's economy since a 1% increase in tourism receipt increases economic growth by about 0.19%. On the contrary, due to a 1% decline in the tourism receipt, economic growth will decrease by about 0.66%. So, the decline in tourism receipt will have a higher negative impact on economic growth than the increase in the tourism receipt in Bangladesh, which result is important for current pandemic situation in tourism due to Covid-19. We also reveal that the impact of positive change in the tourism revenue on GDP stabilizes around 8 years; however, an adverse change on GDP does not stabilize in 15 years. We recommend that a systematic allocation of resources is required to promote and stimulate the tourism industry in Bangladesh for a favourable impact on the country's long-run economic development.

# INTRODUCTION

Economic growth mainly depends on the contribution of different
factors and numerous empirical growth literatures attempt to
explain economic growth based on multiple factors, such as
technology, innovative and intellectual capital, human capital,
export, fiscal policy, monetary policy, financial factors and role
of institutions (Balassa, 1978; McKinnon, 1973; North, 1991;
Peacock and Wiseman, 1961; Robert, 1988; Romer, 1986; Solow,
1956; Tobin, 1965). Tourism revenue is considered an instrument
for export diversification and contributes to the balance of
payments, increased employment opportunities, and government
revenues (Archer, 1995; Durbarry, 2002). Tourism receipt can
promote a country’s economic growth through spillovers and other
externalities (Marin, 1992). Tourism development also provides
foreign revenue and fosters investment in infrastructural and socioeconomic development, which also generates new employment (Blake et al., 2006). The tourism sector’s significance can also be
recognized from the statistics of the World Travel and Tourism
Council (WTTC). In 2019, the contribution of tourism was 8.9
trillion USD globally (10.3% of total global GDP) and created
around 300 million jobs around the world. In the South Asian
region, tourism has contributed 234 billion USD (6.6% of the
region’s total GDP).

In Bangladesh, over the last twenty years, RMG (readymade
garments) exports and remittances are the principal sources
of growth. Majority of the export earnings are concentrated
only on the RMG sector and undiversified export of the RMG
sector, both in terms of product range and market, will increase
the likelihood of vulnerability to different shocks (Raihan
and Bourguignon, 2020). A scenario of the tourism sector in
Bangladesh is reflected in some recent stylized facts highlighted
in the WTTC. Tourism’s total contribution to GDP was 3% of
total GDP in 2019. In 2019, tourism’s total share of employment
was 2.9% of total employment. The tourism sector generates
28.3 billion Taka, which is 0.7% of total exports in 2019. Thus,
the tourism sector can also be seen as a promising alternative for
export diversification, government revenue, and maintaining a
healthy fiscal balance in Bangladesh.

The economic impact of tourism has been broadly studied in
numerous works of literature. It is revealed from the existing
pieces of literature that a positive impact of tourism on the
growth of an economy can be conveyed through different possible
channels. A vast number of empirical pieces of literature focus
on the symmetric time-series models to examine tourism-growth
nexus (Brida et al., 2016). In their pioneering work, Balaguer and
Cantavella-Jorda (2002) have explored the possible link between
tourism and the economy in Spain and found a long-run association
between them. Oh (2005) has examined the tourism-growth nexus
in Korea and found no evidence of a long-run relationship. For
the Taiwanese economy, Kim et al. (2006) have explored the
association between tourism and growth and found the evidence
of a long-run association between the variables. Brida et al. (2008)
have found the evidence of tourism led growth hypothesis in
Colombia. Hye et al. (2013), Tang and Abosedra (2014), Aslan
(2016), Ohlan (2017), Yazdi (2019) and Ribeirio and Wang (2020)
have also found the shreds of evidence of tourism-growth nexus in
Pakistan, Lebanon, Turkey, India, Iran and Sao Tome and Principe
(STP) respectively. Some studies have used panel data models to
examine tourism-growth nexus. Proenca and Soukiazis (2008)
tested the tourism-growth nexus for the four European countries
(Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and found the significant
contribution of tourism on economic growth. Saleh et al. (2015)
checked the existence of the nexus for Bahrain, Jordan, and Saudi
Arabia and found the validity of the linkage between tourism and
growth.


Few studies have also been employed nonlinear techniques to
examine the tourism-growth nexus. Brida et al. (2015) have
used nonlinear techniques to examine tourism led growth
hypothesis. The study has found evidence of a sustainable
relationship between the variables for Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay, and Uruguay. In Jordan, Muhtaseb and Daoud
(2017) have employed both linear and nonlinear cointegration
techniques and found a positive long-run relationship between
tourism and economic growth. This study’s nonlinear technique
has provided a more robust and accurate result to capture any
shock and disturbances on the economy. In Thailand, Fareed
et al. (2018) have used nonlinear autoregressive distributed
lag (NARDL) model to explore the asymmetric association
between tourism and growth. The study has found the presence
of sustainable asymmetric linkage between the variables. In a
recent study, Kumar et al. (2020) have used the NARDL model
to explore the possible long-run asymmetric linkage between
tourism and economic development in the Cook Islands. The
study has found that an addition to the tourist arrival would have
a greater positive impact on growth than the negative effect due
to a decrease in tourist arrival. Husein and Kara (2020) have
utilized the same technique to examine the asymmetric impact
of change in the United States income (real per capita GDP)
on tourism demand for Puerto Rico. The study has revealed a
nonlinear relationship in which any change in the U.S.’s income
has distinct effects on Puerto Rico’s tourism (For details see
the table in the Appendix Table 1)


Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, the tourism
sector has been badly affected around the world. Many countries
have locked their borders, limited domestic and international
travel, and maintained physical distancing initiatives. Every
sub-sector related to tourism, such as transport, hotels, and travel
agencies, is affected due to this crisis. The World Travel and
Tourism Council (WTTC) (2020) has estimated that about 100
million jobs are in jeopardy, and the U.S. $2.7 trillion in revenue
could be lost globally in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to COVID-19, the estimated potential loss of the tourism
sector in Bangladesh will be the U.S. $ 2.03 billion (Twining
and McComb, 2020). It is noteworthy that previously conducted
studies mainly focus on the symmetric models and not consider
the probable asymmetric effects. Besides, the information
transmitted by the linear models is inadequate to provide robust
inference or precise forecasts (Shin et al., 2014). Any negative or
positive shock in the variables cannot be captured adequately by
the linear symmetric models. In this current pandemic situation,
traditional linear models cannot grasp the adverse effect of tourism
receipts on economic growth. To our knowledge, there is no prior
empirical study that examines the tourism-economic growth
nexus for the Bangladesh economy in a NARDL framework.
Previously, Amin (2010) has examined this linkage between
tourism expansion and economic growth in Bangladesh by using
an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework and found a
sustainable equilibrium association between the variables. Amin
et al. (2019) have also explored the long-run association between
tourism and government revenue in Bangladesh by utilizing a
similar technique and have found a long-run linkage between the
variables. This paper is the extension of the previous one, Amin
(2010) by employing the NARDL framework.


To fill the gap, this paper has augmented the NARDL technique
to examine the relationship between tourism development and
economic growth in Bangladesh. Since the NARDL model
has some advantages over the ARDL model1 and can examine
the relationship of the concerned variables in an asymmetric
approach, this present study will give more precise directives
to the policymakers compared to the linear model used in Amin
(2010). The study finds that a 1% increase in the tourism receipt
will increase economic growth by around 0.19%, while a 1%
decrease will decrease the growth by about 0.66%.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces
the econometric models and methodology for explaining the
analysis and the limitations of the study. Section 3 reports
and interprets econometric findings; Section 4 focuses on the
implication of the findings and ends the paper with some policy
recommendations.


# Methods

Following Amin (2010), we have considered following model to addressing our questions in this paper,

$$gdp_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 tour_t + \alpha_2 exc_t + \epsilon_t$$

Where gdp is the GDP of Bangladesh, tour is the tourism receipt of Bangladesh and exc is the exchange rate of Bangladesh. All the variables are taken from 1980 to 2016, and they are converted into the natural logarithmic form to make this model into an elasticity model. This paper augmented Amin's paper by using the exchange rate to examine how inbound tourism depends on the exchange rate. This is because if the exchange rate is higher or depreciates, that will make a country's tourism cheaper than the competing countries (Ertugrul and Mangir, 2015; Husein and Kara, 2020).

The nonlinear ARDL model had some advantages over the ARDL model that is used in Amin (2010). The main drawback of this ARDL model was it assumes a symmetric relationship that means the rate at which GDP increases due to a rise in tourism is the same as the rate of GDP decreases due to tourism decrease. Similarly, like the ARDL model NARDL model is free from residual correlation and endogeneity of regressors. Also, the NARDL model exhibits long run and short run cointegration regardless of the variables I(0), I(1), or integrated at the same order. Unlike the ARDL model, the NARDL model discerns the asymmetric adjustment of the regressors' positive and negative shocks on the explained variable. That means this model can detect if there are any long run and short run asymmetry in the model.

Following, Shin et al. (2014), we will use nonlinear ARDL (p, q1, q2) model as follows,

$$ gdp_t = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j gdp_{t-j} + \sum_{j=0}^{q_1} (\theta_j^{+} tour^{+}_{t-j} + \theta_j^{-} tour^{-}_{t-j}) + \sum_{j=0}^{q_2} (\eta_j^{+} exc^{+}_{t-j} + \eta_j^{-} exc^{-}_{t-j})+ \epsilon_t $$

Here, $\theta_j^+, \theta_j^- , \eta_j^+$ and $\eta_j^-$ are the associated asymmetric long run parameters and $\epsilon_t$ is an $i.i.d.$ process with zero mean and finite variance. $p$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are lag orders and $tour_t(= tour_0 + tour_t^+ + tour_t^-)$ and $exc_t (=exc_0 + exc_t^+ + exc_t^- )$ are vectors with $k\times1$ dimension, entering the model asymmetrically. $tour_t^+$ and $tour_t^-$ denoting the partial sums of positive and negative changes in tourism revenue. Same is true for $exc_t^+$ and $exc_t^-$ This model of partial sum decomposition can be written in the following form,

\begin{equation}\label{tourPSD}
tour_t^{+}= \sum_{j=1}^t \Delta tour_j^+  =  \sum_{j=1}^t max(tour_j, 0)
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
tour_t^{-}= \sum_{j=1}^t \Delta tour_j^-  =  \sum_{j=1}^t min(tour_j, 0)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{excPSD}
exc_t^{+}= \sum_{j=1}^t \Delta exc_j^+  =  \sum_{j=1}^t max(exc_j, 0)
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
exc_t^{-}= \sum_{j=1}^t \Delta exc_j^-  =  \sum_{j=1}^t min(exc_j, 0)
\end{equation} Equation \ref{mainNARDL} can be formulized into a conditional nonlinear error correction model(ECM) in the following format,

```{=tex}
\begin{multline}\label{nonlinearECM}
\Delta gdp_t = \rho \xi_{t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \delta_j \Delta gdp_{t-j}+ \sum_{j=0}^{q_1 - 1} (\pi_j^+ \Delta tour_{t-j}^+  + \pi_j^- \Delta  tour_{t-j}^- )\\
 + \sum_{j=0}^{q_2 - 1} (\lambda^+ \Delta exc_{t-j}^+  + \lambda^- \Delta  exc_{t-j}^- ) + e_t
\end{multline}
```
Where, $\rho = \sum_{j=1}^p \phi_j - 1$ and $\xi_t = gdp_t - \alpha^+ tour_{t}^+ - \alpha^- tour_{t}^- - \beta^+ exc_t^+ - \beta^- exc_t^-$ is the non-linear error correction term where, $\alpha^+ = - \theta^+ / \rho$ , $\alpha^- = - \theta^- / \rho$, $\beta^+ = - \eta^+ / \rho$ and $\beta^+ = - \eta^- / \rho$. Also, $\sum_{j=0}^{q_1 -1} \pi^+$ and $\sum_{j=0}^{q_1 -1} \pi^-$ shows short run influences of increase and decrease of tourism revenue on GDP. Similarly, $\sum_{j=0}^{q_2 -1} \lambda^+$ and $\sum_{j=0}^{q_2 -1} \lambda^-$ shows, influences of increase and decrease of exchange rate on GDP.

Therefore equation \ref{nonlinearECM} can be framed into nonlinear ARDL-based ECM in the following format.

```{=tex}
\begin{multline}\label{nARDL}
\Delta gdp_t = c + \phi_j gdp_{t-j} + \theta_j^{+} tour^{+}_{t-j} + \theta_j^{-} tour^{-}_{t-j} + \eta_j^{+} exc^{+}_{t-j} + \eta_j^{-} exc^{-}_{t-j}\\
 + \sum_{j=1}^{p-1} \delta_j \Delta gdp_{t-j}+ \sum_{j=0}^{q_1 - 1} (\pi_j^+ \Delta tour_{t-j}^+  + \pi_j^- \Delta  tour_{t-j}^- ) + \sum_{j=0}^{q_2 - 1} (\lambda^+ \Delta exc_{t-j}^+  + \lambda^- \Delta  exc_{t-j}^- ) + e_t
\end{multline}
```
In equation 8c is the restricted constant. This is the case-2 of conditional error correction model (CECM) by Pesaran et al. (2001). The value of $\theta^{+},\theta^{-},\eta^{+},\eta^{-}$ in equation \ref{nARDL} should be positive. As, the positive value of $\theta^{+}$ shows, as tourism revenue increases, GDP would increase and positive value of $\theta^{-}$ show as tourism revenue decreases GDP would decrease too. This is what tourism led growth hypothesis or growth led tourism hypothesis suggests. Same way positive value of $\eta^{+}$ and $\eta^{-}$ shows that if exchange rate increases that means exchange rate depreciates against the dollar, which makes tourism in BD cheaper which in turn creates GDP to increase.

To see if there is any long-run relationship or cointegration among these variables we will first apply F-statistics from equation 8, where our null hypothesis is there is no cointegration that is ($H_0 : \phi = \theta^+ = \theta^- = \eta = 0$). Then to ensure this cointegration is not nonsensical cointegration or degenerate cointegration normally t-bounds statistics of Banerjee et al (1998) is used. However, in case the data generating process(DGP) has a trend or a constant then t-test can not be used. After that, we used null hypothesis of long run symmetry of GDP using the wald test. Which uses a $\chi^2$ distribution with null hypothesis that there is no difference between $\theta^+$ and $\theta^-$ that is $H_0: \theta^+ = \theta^-$.

# Results

Even though it is not necessary for the variables to integrated at the same order for NARDL model, but if there is any variable which is I(2) then the model would be invalid. Therefore, we first checked the unit root test and found that there is no variable, which is integrated at I (2).
![](table_1.jpg)

From Table 1 we see that value of $F_{PSS}$ statistic is significant at 5% level. Therefore, it is definite that there is a cointegrating relationship among these variables. Also, from the table, $\chi^2_{SC}$ and $\chi^2_{HET}$ are the serial correlation test and heteroskedasticity test for the residuals, respectively. In the serial correlation test, the null hypothesis is there is no serial correlation in the residuals, and in the heteroskedasticity test, the null hypothesis is that residuals are homoskedastic. Both of these tests can not reject the null hypothesis, therefore, we can safely say that this model's residual is linear uncorrelated and homoskedastic. Lastly, we can see that Wald test statistics for tourism are significant at 1% level, which means there is a significant asymmetric relationship between GDP and tourism revenue. From the Figure 1, we can see that recursive estimation using CUSUM and CUSUM of the square is within the 5% significance level, and therefore, the coefficients of this model are stable over the study period.
